# EZCCX

EZCCX is an iOS runtime modifications which allows you to present the control center by swiping down on the homebar (the default reachability trigger).

If you use reachability, turn on EZCCX - Swipe Up in settings. This will make it so you can activate reachability normally. Swiping up on the bar when reachability is activated will trigger the control center presentation.

## Installation

Once an update for Cydia is available, this package will be on a public repo for easy installation. Electra users can find the dylib, plist, and settings files here: [EZCCX.zip](https://github.com/CPDigitalDarkroom/EZCCX/releases)
